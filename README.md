# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Youtube-Comments

The main goal of this project was to identify which is more preferred phone amongst the consumers between Samsung Galaxy S10 and iPhone X by analyzing the sentiment of the general public and also identify which are the most talked about features about the phones. To identify this, we decided to pick comments from a YouTube review video of these phones and we decided to run sentiment analysis on the comments in order to achieve our goal
•	The approach was to first perform data cleaning and any transformations that were required 
•	Then we set out to explore the data set, and created a word frequency chart which told us about the count of every single word used in this dataset 
•	Next what we did was, we identified the most talked about features which were price, camera, battery, user interface, sound, performance to compare both the phones. 
•	Using  labelling then, I was able to sort the comments based on the relevancy, and we filtered out the most irrelevant comments
•	Once that was done, we used nltk library in python to use sentiment intensity analyzer to find the sentiment score of all relevant comments, whether the sentence is positive, negative or neutral and plotted the same to communicate the findings. 

Result:
•	iPhone had way more positive reviews and especially has better performance, price, camera and sound. People for a change though seemed to have a positive sentiment on Samsung S10’s user interface.
